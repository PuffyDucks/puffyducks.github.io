  <h1>If it doesn't work, check the url and if you see a sheild, click it, press load, and try again.</h1>
  <h3>This is an IFrame.</h3> Basically a website in a website. Put a link in the text box up there and press the "Go" button (pressing enter doesn't work). Links need http:// at the beginning or else they won't work. Some websites, like Google, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, and Spotify won't work unfortunately. Don't be surprised if you try to go onto a website and it doesn't work. Instead of Google, use https://bing.com. You can just use the bookmarks on the bottom of this page. Made by PuffyDucks. <br/><br/> Just to clarify, this is not a proxy or anything illegal, just a little project of mine to test out IFrames and CSS and div and other nerd stuff. It is the exact same as your normal browser except with much less features.
