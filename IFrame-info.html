  <h3>This is an IFrame.</h3> Basically a website in a website. Put a link in the text box up there and press the "Go" button (pressing enter doesn't work). Links need http:// at the beginning or else they won't work. Some websites, like Google, Yahoo, and Spotify won't work unfortunately. Don't be surprised if you try to go onto a website and it doesn't work. Instead of Google, use https://duckduckgo.com. You can just use the bookmarks on the bottom of this page. Made by PuffyDucks.
